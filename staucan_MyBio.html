                        Throughout each weekend I ensure that I spend quality time with each of my family members and I space them out over the course of the month.
                        I have a grand total of 9 nieces and nephews and I try to see each of them throughout the month. 
                        It may take some time, however, it is well worth it!

                        I started competitive swimming freshman year of High School and I have not regretted that decision at all throughout the years.

                        This is where I began my Disney career. I started back in 2007 working as a Park Greeter at the age of 15, then moved into non-moving attractions at the age 
                        of 16. I then became a trainer and a coordinator proficient cast member.
