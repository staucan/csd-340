                        Throughout each weekend I ensure that I spend quality time with each of my family members and I space them out over the course of the month.
                        I have a grand total of 9 nieces and nephews and I try to see each of them throughout the month. 
                        It may take some time, however, it is well worth it!

                        I started competitive swimming freshman year of High School and I have not regretted that decision at all throughout the years. 
                        It has taught me great decipline and it absolutely amazing. There is no better feeling than swimming through water and work through your thoughts and emotions.

                        This is where I began my Disney career. I started back in 2007 working as a Park Greeter at the age of 15, then moved into non-moving attractions at the age 
                        of 16. I then became a trainer and a coordinator proficient cast member.

                        After growing and learning in my prior role for 7 years, I transfered over to Disneys Miniature Golf Courses to showcase what I had already learned and to 
                        learn more things. I learned how to manage money and balace registers, work with food and beverage along with sales.
